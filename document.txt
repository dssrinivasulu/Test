First Lady Jill Biden will welcome guests to join her in the viewing box for President Biden’s State of the Union Address on Tuesday, February 7, 2023. 

Each of these individuals were invited by the White House because they personify issues or themes to be addressed by the President in his speech, or they embody the Biden-Harris Administration’s policies at work for the American people.

The Second Gentleman, Mr. Douglas Emhoff, will also join the First Lady in the viewing box.   
 
In recognition of sustained U.S. support for Ukraine nearly a year after Russia launched its unprovoked attack, the First Lady has again invited the Ambassador of Ukraine, Oksana Markarova, to join her as a guest for the State of the Union. 

The Barrons’ three-year old daughter, Ava, is a survivor of a rare form of pediatric cancer. Mr. Barron penned a letter to the President to express gratitude for the Bidens’ commitment to the Cancer Moonshot initiative and share their experience as parents and caregivers of a child with cancer. 

In 2022, Ava’s doctors gave the Barrons good news by officially declaring her in remission. 

Their family’s story is one of hope and possibility, inspiring us to continue working towards a future where we end cancer as we know it.

Bonar is an enrolled member of Navajo Nation. She was a sergeant and former medic in the U.S. Army. 

She spent 19 years providing clinical care as a Registered Nurse and Executive at the Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation, including eight years as Chief Executive Officer. 

In 2019, Dr. Biden joined Bonar to celebrate the opening of the Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation’s Specialty Care Center which was the first cancer center opened on a Native American reservation, bringing cancer treatment and other oncology services to the Navajo, Hopi, and San Juan Southern Paiute tribal members who previously had to travel great distances to receive care.
